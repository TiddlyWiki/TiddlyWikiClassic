title: Setting up saving
type: text/x-tiddlywiki

Since version 2.8.1, ~TiddlyWiki has a fallback saver. If no saver method is configured, pressing "save changes" will display a download dialog. The browser may prompt for the location to save the file. Select the existing version of the file to replace it. This method works on most major browsers, but does not provide an ideal user experience as it requires manual intervention for each save. Below are various tools that remove this routine from saving.
!Another native saver
[[ContinuousSavingPlugin|https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ContinuousSavingPlugin/]] allows to reduce the manual steps of saving to just one file picking per session. However, it has a limited browser support (currently, desktop Chrome, Chromium-based browsers, and Edge; see more details in the plugin repository). Presumably, it will be included in the future versions of TW.
!Browser Plugins
Plugins are simple to install and provide smooth user experience, but they are also platform- and browser-specific to some extent. Mobile browsers don't support them.

!Standalone applications
Desktop applications provide automatic saving and are not browser dependent. The disadvantage is they don't offer tabs for browsing and require your ~TiddlyWiki file to be a inside a specific folder. Current ones are based on [[NW.js|https://nwjs.io/]], which means they run at least on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

!Serverside applications
These methods for automatic saving are somewhat advanced, but allow for placing ~TiddlyWiki on a server (local or remote) and generally work with any browser.

!Mobile
All of solutions above should work in most desktop ~OSs like Windows, Mac or other Unix family OS (Linux, Ubuntu, etc). While some may work on mobile devices, applications written for the respective platform are usually simpler to setup and have better performance.

!Hosted Options
Also, you can store your TW(s) on a server, for example:
* [[Tiddlyhost|https://tiddlyhost.com/]], a free hosting service for ~TiddlyWiki
* (This list should be expanded, you can suggest edits by clicking "suggest edits" and following the instructions)
* (See also HostedOptions, but some of them are outdated)
